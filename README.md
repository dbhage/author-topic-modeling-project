The goal of this project is to identify discourses (or topics) that accompany the discussion of certain authors within the field of literary criticism. So when we talk about Goethe or Jane Austen, what kinds of things (topics) do we typically talk about? Do we find that certain critical methods are discussed more often in reference to certain authors? We perform topic modeling on articles (JSTOR) as well as author name recognition with the goal of discovering patterns.
