The goal of this project is to identify discourses (or topics) that accompany the discussion of certain authors within the field of literary criticism. So when we talk about Goethe or Jane Austen, what kinds of things (topics) do we typically talk about? Do we find that certain critical methods are discussed more often in reference to certain authors? We perform topic modeling on articles (JSTOR) as well as author name recognition with the goal of discovering patterns.

The whole project is coded using python and includes but is not limited to:
- Implemented wrappers for the MALLET tool for importing data and running the topic modeler.
- Scripts to parse mallet output files (compositions, keys)
- Scripts to pre-process data in a form acceptable to mallet
- Implemented various measures to produce tables used to generate graphs
- Test cases for the code
