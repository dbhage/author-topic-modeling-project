The goal of this project is to identify discourses (or topics) that accompany the discussion of certain authors within the field of literary criticism. So when we talk about Goethe or Jane Austen, what kinds of things (topics) do we typically talk about? Do we find that certain critical methods are discussed more often in reference to certain authors? We perform topic modeling on articles (JSTOR) as well as author name recognition with the goal of discovering patterns.

This repository contains python code for performing the above.
There are python wrappers around the MALLET tool for importing data and running the topic modeler. All the python modules and scripts required are in the repo.

Both the source code and test code are available.
